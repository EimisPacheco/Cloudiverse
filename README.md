## 🎯 Inspiration

I wanted to create a fun and engaging way for people to learn cloud concepts across all major cloud providers by making the learning process interactive and enjoyable. I mixed my love for learning new skills with my passion for cloud architecture to build a game that helps players practice real-world cloud skills from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud in a playful and memorable way.

### 🎯 Cloud Shooter - SkyStrike Mode
This is a browser-based shooting game where players blast cloud service icons from AWS, Azure, or GCP. The goal is to help players recognize cloud services across all providers and associate them with their categories through quick thinking and fast reactions.

**Key Features:**
- Canvas-based game rendering with smooth animations
- Multi-cloud service recognition (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Player controls (mouse movement and clicking)
- Dynamic scoring system with height bonuses
- Sound effects and visual feedback
- Cross-provider high score tracking

**Gameplay Logic:**
- Dynamically loads icons for the current cloud provider and service category
- Randomly selects target icons from categories like Compute, Storage, AI, Networking
- Smart hit detection with immediate feedback
- Positive reinforcement for correct matches (+5 points + height bonus)
- Educational corrections for mismatches (-5 points with learning feedback)
- Multiple game states: provider selection, name entry, spaceship selection, gameplay, and results

### 📄 Match Icons & Definitions - Cross-Cloud Knowledge Mode
Players match cloud services with their definitions across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud! The game dynamically generates service names and corresponding definitions, helping users understand equivalent services across different cloud providers.

**Multi-Cloud Learning:**
- Compare AWS Lambda vs Azure Functions vs Google Cloud Functions
- Understand storage differences: S3 vs Blob Storage vs Cloud Storage
- Learn networking: VPC vs VNet vs VPC Network

### 🧠 Icons Memory - Multi-Provider Memory Challenge
Test your memory by matching pairs of cloud service icons across all three major cloud providers! This game helps reinforce visual recognition of services across different cloud ecosystems.

### 🗂️ Category Challenge - Speed Classification Mode
Test your knowledge by quickly selecting all icons belonging to specific cloud categories across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Learn to identify:
- **Compute Services**: EC2, Virtual Machines, Compute Engine
- **Storage Solutions**: S3, Blob Storage, Cloud Storage
- **Database Options**: RDS, Cosmos DB, Cloud SQL
- **AI/ML Services**: SageMaker, Cognitive Services, AI Platform

### 🧩 Architecture Puzzle - Multi-Cloud Architecture Builder
Players complete cloud architecture diagrams by dragging the correct services into missing slots. This mode helps users understand how equivalent services across different cloud providers fit into real-world scenarios.
